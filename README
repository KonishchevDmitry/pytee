pytee - A video player for watching movies with subtitles

This program is intended to make life easier for people who watches TV shows or
films on foreign language with subtitles for the purpose of learning this
language. It allows you to watch a few subtitles simultaneously, copy a part of
subtitle text (for example, to pass it to a dictionary) and switch to a movie
with alternative translation (for example, if subtitles are not so good).

pytee uses MPlayer as a backend.
